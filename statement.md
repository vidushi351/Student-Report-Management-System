# Student Record Management — Project Statement

## 🔹 Problem Statement
You know how teachers and the office staff always lose track of everyone's grades, or they have to flip through a giant stack of papers just to find your Student ID? That’s super annoying and takes forever! When the principal needs to quickly know the average math grade for the whole class, they shouldn't have to spend their lunch break counting. This project fixes this by taking all the student info and putting it in one organized, easy-to-use digital spot.

## 🔹 Scope of the Project
- File Management: It will let you do all the necessary moves on a student's file: add a new one, look it up, change a grade, or delete it.
- Data That Stays: All the student info will be saved safely to a local file on the computer, like a simple spreadsheet or a text file. It won't disappear when the program is closed.
- Simple Search: It will let you quickly find students by their name or filter the list by their major.
- Quick Math: It can run basic reports, like sorting students by GPA or calculating the average grade for a specific class.

## 🔹 Target Users
The Main User: It's perfect for the Department Secretary or the Academic Assistant who actually has to type in the grades, update the addresses, and find a student's file quickly.

## 🔹 High-Level Features
- "Set It and Forget It" Saving: You don't have to hit a "Save" button every five minutes. The program automatically records everything you enter into a safe file, so when you come back tomorrow, all your student data is waiting for you.
- Smart Search: You can type in a name or student ID and jump straight to that record.
- Total Control of the Files: You can instantly perform all the necessary actions on any student's record:
 1- Add: Get a brand-new student into the system.
 2- View: Pull up their entire file in a second.
 3- Change: Fix a typo or update a new grade.
 4- Remove: Delete an old file when a student graduates.
